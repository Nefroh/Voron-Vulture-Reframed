# Voron-Vulture-"Reframed"
! Early WIP !  
This project started as just a repo for me to catalogue the mods and configs of my Voron Trident 250, but has ballooned into designing new paneling, skirt etc for my weird Frankenvoron.

The main motivation behind this: stiffening up the frame + adding extra space for electronics, without it costing too much. 
I achieved this by essentially just bolting a bunch of extrusions to the frame, and the result so far works very nicely.
Most of the profiles i used were spares i had lying around from a disassembled Tronxy 400 and an Ender 5, which is why some of the dimensions might be wonky.
